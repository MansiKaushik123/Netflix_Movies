**Project Summary -**

Netflix, Inc. is a company from the United States that provides a service where you can watch videos whenever you want after subscribing. It's like a streaming service in Los Gatos, California. It was started by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in 1997 in Scotts Valley, California. They have a collection of movies and TV shows that they show through agreements with others and their own creations called Netflix Originals.

**In this project, I have done the following things:-**

1. Exploratory Data Analysis.

2. Understanding what type content is available in different countries.

3. Is Netflix increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years?

4. Clustering similar content by matching text-based features.

5. **Problem Statement:-**

6. This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

**Conclusion:-**

1- It's interesting to observe that most of what you can watch on Netflix are movies. However, in recent times, the platform has been paying more attention to TV shows.

2- These shows mostly come out either towards the start or the end of the year.

3- Among all the countries contributing content to Netflix, the United States and India stand out in the top five. Additionally, out of the ten actors who have the most content, six are from India.

4- When we look at content ratings, TV-MA is the leader, showing that mature content is quite popular on Netflix.

5- The number "k" that worked best for categorizing the data was 15. This number was used to put the content into ten different groups.

6- With this information, a recommender system was made based on the content itself. It used cosine similarity to suggest Movies and TV shows for you to watch.

**Future Work**

Combining this dataset with outside information like IMDB ratings, grouping of books, and categorizing plant types could uncover many fascinating findings.

By adding more data, we could create a better recommendation system that gives users even better suggestions. This improved system could be put on the internet for lots of people to use.![238554569-17bb2e8d-e49e-425b-a784-473f96a6abc6](https://github.com/MansiKaushik123/Netflix_Movies/assets/140509411/05d285bd-0210-434d-b304-be0fcc94b457)
